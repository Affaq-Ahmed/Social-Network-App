# Social-Network-App
Build a Social network backend for users to connect and share posts. A user should be able to sign up and follow/unfollow other users. A feed will show all the posts by users we follow. Additionally the feed can be hidden behind a paywall and integrated with stripe to create a subscription or a one time payment option. Another layer of users could be added to moderate the content on the network.
